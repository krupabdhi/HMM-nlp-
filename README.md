# HMM-nlp-
Problem Statement:
 you need to modify the Viterbi algorithm to solve the problem of unknown words using at least two techniques.
 Solution:
1) Plain HMM-based POS tagger is built using the Viterbi Heuristic and the performance is evaluated on the validation dataset.
..> The (first) technique used to modify the algorithm is based on sound observations of unknown words and is explained clearly in comments/markdown text.
..> The modified Viterbi POS tagger algorithm is evaluated on the validation and the test datasets and the results show some non-trivial improvement over the original algorithm.
..> Sample (test) cases are listed which were incorrectly tagged by the original Viterbi POS tagger but got corrected by the modification.
2) The (second) technique used to modify the algorithm is based on sound observations of unknown words and is explained clearly in comments/markdown text.
..> The modified Viterbi POS tagger algorithm is evaluated on the validation and the test datasets and the results show some non-trivial improvement over the original algorithm.
..> Sample (test) cases are listed which were incorrectly tagged by the original Viterbi POS tagger but got corrected by the modification.
